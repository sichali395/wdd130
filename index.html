                <p>Greetings! I am Laston James Sichali, a dedicated software development student from Malawi, Africa. My academic journey is through the BYU Pathway Worldwide program at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I am gaining the skills to not just code, but to create. I am deeply motivated by the potential of technology to empower communities, improve access to information, and drive sustainable growth. My vision is to contribute to the growing tech ecosystem in Malawi and across Africa, building tools that make a tangible difference in people's lives.</p>

                <p>Karonga is a northern lakeshore district in Malawi, situated on the western shore of Lake Malawi. It is a historical and archaeological hub, known for its significant fossil discoveries, including ancient dinosaur remains. The area's economy is primarily based on agriculture, particularly rice farming, and fishing in the lake.</p>
                <p>Malawi is a small, landlocked country in Southeast Africa, famously known as "The Warm Heart of Africa" due to the renowned friendliness of its people. Its most dominant feature is the massive freshwater Lake Malawi, which covers about a third of the country and is home to hundreds of unique fish species. The landscape is defined by its highlands, plateaus, and the Great Rift Valley. Malawi's economy is predominantly agricultural, relying heavily on tobacco, tea, and sugar. It is a nation of stunning natural beauty, rich culture, and resilience.</p>
