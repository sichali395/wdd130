                <p>Founded by siblings Zebron, Angel, and Destiny Sichali, Splash White Water Rafting began with a simple passion for adventure and a deep respect for nature. Their operation is based along the scenic Songwe River in the Karonga District of Northern Malawi, a region that shares a vibrant border with Tanzania. What started as their small family operation has grown into a premier rafting destination, guiding thousands of visitors through thrilling river experiences each year. This growth is a testament to their commitment to safety, exceptional guiding, and the unique beauty of the river. They take great pride in offering a range of experiences that showcase the stunning landscapes of their home district, from gentle flows to exhilarating rapids. A core part of their mission is to foster a conservation ethic, ensuring visitors leave with a deeper appreciation for the Songwe River's ecosystem. The original family values of personal service and adventurous spirit continue to be the heart of the company as it welcomes adventurers from across the globe.</p>
